		"description": "“Tahara” uses its sound design, inspired by Radiolab and Kelly Reichardt, to create deeply textured and emotionally resonant sonic narratives. The deliberate directorial choices, from the absence of a traditional score to the square aspect ratio, allow a multi-dimensional auditory experience to emerge - between the magnified Foley and expansive ambiences - one that uncovers the intricate inner worlds of its young adult characters as they navigate the challenges of aging, processing mortality, falling in love, filling in identity, and finding spirituality.",

			{
				"publication": "The New York Times",
				"quote": "“The Hebrew-school comedy “Tahara” mimics the zinging pleasure of overhearing teenagers chatter as they walk home from school: It’s gossipy, delicious and a tad cruel. The film eavesdrops on a group of teenage students during a critical day in their lives, when a classmate’s funeral has prompted them to wrestle with social status and school personas. Their dialogue crackles with vocal fry and viciousness as they reckon, maybe for the first time, with the consequences of school hierarchies.”"

However, there is an emotional precision that the filmmaker is able to achieve, a skill they brought over from their narrative feature “Tahara” that is among the most promising debuts in recent years."

As Aubrey, Santana, Raziah, and Ja’Ana get ready for the special event, they speak candidly about their hopes, dreams, and disappointments. There is an innate wisdom and honesty to what they share about their dads’ inconsistent presence; an awareness far beyond their years. Daughters meaningfully challenges many stereotypes around incarceration and serves as a poignant reminder that maintaining family bonds can be both healing and empowering.",
